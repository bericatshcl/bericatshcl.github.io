<br>
<br>
<p3><font color="#e69500"><center>These  are the official rules for the Smash Heroes Competitive League Solo Tournament. Breaking the rules will result in being suspended or possibly banned from playing in future tournaments.</center></font>
<br>- Be a decent sport. This is tournament is for the sake of playing Smash with each other at a higher level for the sake of playing competitively and improving yourself, no need to be toxic.
<br>
<br>- Fights should be done in 1v1 mode, if there are people in the game to spectate or record they need to spectate through the 1v1 spectator system. Recording of matches is encouraged.
<br>
<br>- Best of five matches.
<br>
<br>- Disconnects and crashes mid game are to be evaluated according to the situation, if the person had a massive advantage and crashed, and have most likely won the game they would get the match. 
<br>
<br>- If you participated in the last tournament, and were in the top four, you are unable to participate in the current tournament. This is to vary the results of each tournament and allow different people into each tournament.
<br>
<br>- For each game of a set between two players, each player has two map skips available to them. A player must announce their desire to skip before the game begins to the party leader in private. Skips persist during the entirety of map selection, if a skipped map is found again before the game starts, it is still skipped. Skips reset between games of a set. If both players agree to skip a map, it will be skipped with neither player using one of their two skips. You MUST message the party leader if you want to skip, skips said publicly will be used and not skip the map.
<br>
<br>- In the first game of the set, both players will choose their character without telling the other player who they have chosen.
For subsequent games, the winner of the previous game must state which character they select for the next game. Only then will the loser of the previous game state their character.
<br>
<br>- You CANNOT use a nickname or alt in tournaments.
<br>
<br>- You MUST play your matches!<p2>
